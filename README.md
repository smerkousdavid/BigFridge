# BigFridge
This repo is a resting place for a small coding challenge I did in Vue.js. Actually, it can count as my first project/challenge that I've done using Vue.js and I really enjoyed it (I didn't use all of its features but it was still fairly simple to use). 

#### Installation
-------------------------
**Clone the repository**<br />
```
$ git clone https://github.com/smerkousdavid/BigFridge && cd BigFridge
```
**Server**<br />
The server is a simple node.js script located in the root of the project called server.js. This hosts the static files as well at the specified port in config.json.
```
$ yarn install # install the dependencies
$ yarn start # start the server
```
Now you can visit http://localhost:8080 to see the demo big fridge<br />
That's it!
